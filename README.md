## Team Gen

TeamGen's was born from the need to create balanced football teams, since randomly splitting individuals doesn't really work. 💁‍♀️The idea is then to, given a group of players, generate two balanced groups. It uses, to a certain extent, the ideas described [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_problem). 

Although originally set to be for football teams, and sports in general, it can be applied to pretty much anything:

- Board games.
- School projects.

The initial idea was to allow the split the group into two groups, allowing the user to split into N groups (`where N < (Total number of Users/ 2`) extends its usefulness beyond sports. 🤓
